This folder contains subforlders which has RTL implementation of following activation functions :
* **Softmax** : The softmax function converts a vector of raw scores (logits) into probabilities that sum to 1. Itâ€™s commonly used in the output layer of classification models to represent class probabilities.  

\[
\sigma(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
\]
